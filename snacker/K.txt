Snacker cares about users privacy and, doesn't collect any personal information from users in any way. Users need to provide storage read and write permission at the start to import previously downloaded videos(if any after clearing or reinstalling the app), and for downloading the latest videos to internal storage. However, you can deny it at the start or revoke storage permission at any time. Further, any input or downloaded video details stay or are saved within your device and are wiped out when you close, uninstall or clear the data app data. 

If you have any questions, concerns or suggestions you can tell us in the review section of the Google Play Store.
