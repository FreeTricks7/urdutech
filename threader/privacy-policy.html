    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Thank you for choosing the Threader Video, Images, and Audio Downloader ("the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your experience with our App is safe and secure. This Privacy Policy outlines how the App handles permissions, data, third-party services, and your privacy.</p>

    <h2>1. Permissions Required</h2>
    <p>The App requires certain permissions to function correctly, particularly for downloading and managing media files (videos, images, and audio). These permissions are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Read and Write External Storage Permission:</strong> This permission allows the App to save downloaded media (videos, images, and audio) to your device's storage. It also allows the App to read existing media files on your device to show them in the App interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Read Media Video, Audio, and Images Permission (for Android 13 and above):</strong> On devices running Android 13 or higher, this permission allows the App to access video, audio, and image files stored on your device. It is necessary to access media for download purposes and to display them correctly in the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. What Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>While the App does not collect any personal information directly, it uses third-party services that may collect certain data for analytics and advertising purposes. The App does not collect or process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal identification information (such as name, email address, phone number, etc.).</li>
        <li>Location data.</li>
        <li>User behavior or activity within the app outside of what is collected by third-party services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How Permissions Are Used</h2>
    <p>The permissions requested by the App are solely used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessing and managing media files:</strong> The App requires access to your device's storage and media files (videos, images, and audio) to download, save, and display them within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Storing downloaded content:</strong> Downloaded media files are saved directly to your device's external storage, allowing you to access them outside of the App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use these permissions for any other purposes.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses third-party services for analytics and advertisements, which may collect and use certain data. These services include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Firebase Analytics helps us understand how users interact with the App, track performance, and improve the user experience. Firebase Analytics does not collect any personally identifiable information, and data collected is used solely for analyzing the App's usage patterns. For more details, please refer to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Facebook Audience Network Ads:</strong> The App uses Facebook Audience Network to display advertisements. Facebook may collect certain data to deliver personalized ads. You can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device settings or by visiting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/" target="_blank">Facebook’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. How We Share Data</h2>
    <p>We do not share personal information directly with any third parties. However, the third-party services we use (as listed above) may collect and share data in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take the security of your data seriously. While the App does not collect personal data directly, the third-party services we use have their own security measures in place to protect the data they collect. We recommend that users follow best practices for securing their devices, such as using strong passwords and keeping the device software up to date.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not target or knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has used the App and shared personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App or on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates. The "Effective Date" at the top will indicate when the latest changes were made.</p>
